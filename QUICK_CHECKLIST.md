## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you see "Invalid identity pool configuration"

1. Check Identity Pool has authenticated role assigned
2. Make sure role ARN is correct: `arn:aws:iam::873828695513:role/service-role/mycredentials-2`
3. Verify trust relationships in the role

### If you see "not authorized to perform: dynamodb:PutItem"

1. Check DynamoDB policy is attached to `mycredentials-2`
2. Verify Resource ARN: `arn:aws:dynamodb:ap-south-1:873828695513:table/expenses`
3. Make sure all DynamoDB actions are included

### If you see "No credentials found in session"

1. Try signing out and signing back in
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for detailed error

### If everything looks good but still not working

1. Wait 1-2 minutes (AWS permissions take time to propagate)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Refresh the page
4. Try adding a new expense again
